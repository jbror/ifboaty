# Ifboaty

Ifboaty is a personal boat management platform designed to help boat owners organize, visualize, and keep track of everything related to their boat — from onboard inventory to knowledge, projects, and routines.

The goal of Ifboaty is to replace scattered notes, spreadsheets, and memory with a clear, visual, and structured system tailored specifically for life on a boat.

## ✨ Core Idea

At the heart of Ifboaty is **structured and flexible organization**.

Inventory information is not locked to a single view. Instead, the same data can be explored in different ways depending on the situation — visually or as structured lists.

The visual layout of the boat provides an intuitive understanding of *where things are stored*, while list-based views allow fast searching, filtering, and overall overview when needed.

## 🚤 Main Features

### 📦 Inventory (Core Feature)

The inventory system combines **visual context** with **powerful list-based management**.

**Visual View**
- A simple SVG-based layout of the boat
- Interactive markers represent storage areas and compartments
- Selecting an area displays all items stored in that location
- Designed for spatial understanding and quick orientation onboard

**List View**
- A complete list of all items stored on the boat
- Search for items by name
- Filter and sort by:
  - Storage location
  - Category or type
- Optimized for fast access, editing, and overall overview

Both views are connected to the same underlying data and can be used interchangeably depending on the task.  
This makes it easy to quickly answer questions like *“Where is this stored?”* or *“Do I already have one of these?”*.

- Designed for long-term reference, not quick notes

---

### 🛠 Projects
- Manage ongoing and planned work on the boat
- Create projects with:
  - Description
  - Required materials
  - Notes
  - Optional deadlines
- Ideal for refits, repairs, and improvements

---

### ✅ Checklists
- Reusable checklists for recurring routines
- Examples:
  - Preparing for a one-week sailing trip
  - Winterizing the boat

## 🖼 Example Wireframes

This repository includes example wireframes used to explore and communicate early ideas around layout, navigation, and interaction.

These wireframes are **visual concept demos only** — they are not final designs and do not represent completed functionality.  
They exist to illustrate ideas and guide future development.
